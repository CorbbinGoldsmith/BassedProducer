# krUmUHr - "Tonal Palette Expander"

Plugins are expensive! I heard you! 



Ever drooled over Chroma's juicy harmonic sugar-free sweetening only to check your wallet and find you don't even have enough to buy groceries?

You're sitting there, about to roll out a new track, you've spent hours on it, and just need that one color bass to make it shine. You need that Chroma plugin fix to turn your track into something even Skrillex would be proud of. You're just $36 short of buying it when you get to the checkout.

## Introducing NASA Approved "krUmUHr"

Based on the "Chroma", I made a "tonal palette expander" that skips the algorithmic goodness of Chroma and goes straight for the gold in the easiest most basic way possible.

krUmUHr is this thing that adds tones and color to your sounds with "adaptive formant shifting" which moves the formants to the correct tuned position -- blah blah math. You don't need to know the math to use it, but you need to know the math to make it. That's why I'm here. 

If you don't have the budget for Chroma, and want to test out something similar, and without studying the math, you can just buy this for 1/10th the price. That's like, instead of paying car insurance, you pay for a burger instead. Burgers are much yummier than car insurance.

I made krUmUHr so you don't have to pirate their work and can have a tester version until you want to invest in the big guns.

Who am I?

Now, you might be thinking, "Who is this guy to create a Chroma alternative?" Fair question. 

I'm not just your average music producer tinkering in my bedroom (though I do plenty of that). What sets me apart is my 13 years of deep dive into the exact mathematics needed to create krUmUHr.

But it gets better.

Remember when I mentioned all that "blah blah math" earlier? Well, I learned that math from a NASA physicist who worked as a professor at Sonoma State University. Yeah, you read that right. NASA.

So when I say krUmUHr is based on solid science, I mean rocket-science level solid.

I've taken all that high-level knowledge and distilled it down into something you can use without needing a Ph.D. in acoustics. It's not fancy, but it works. Just how NASA likes it. 

And yes, my name is written in space for my contribution.

I'm not here to bash Chroma.

I'm here to sell you something. But, if you think that it's worth buying Chroma for $40, because you want the exact sound you need, perfected by audiophiles with glasses, by all means! Go for it!

But here's the kicker: you won't get it to work on machines from before MacOS 12 or Windows 10+. So if you're trying to get a crazy morphing color bass on WindowsXP, good luck. 

This is limited

If my predictions are correct, just releasing this will get enough attention that big sound designers will recognize my talent and genius and I will have to sell this with them. That means, I will have to take this down, and won't be able to share it at this price.

Still on the fence?

How about this. If you get krUmUHr right now, and you are not 100% satisfied, I will personally pay you back with a personal phone call and an apology for wasting your time with my terrible sales letter and time in the check out. Hell, I might even get to strike you a deal of getting a discount on Chroma, if they let me.

Go ahead and go DIY it. But...

You could make this same thing for yourself, just like I did. Sure. You could be spending at hours of organizing, testing, making and balancing plugins, correcting, and testing more until your ears bleed, bouncing to audio, realizing you got it all wrong to start from scratch, just to do it all over again. Just like I did.

Or, for $4 you could have all these samples on your computer so you can use them forever, and I've already done the work for you.

What you get:

You get a folder impulse responses you can use in Ableton with Max For Live's Convolution Reverb Pro and FL Studio's convolution reverb or any other convolution reverb plugin. 

I paid my chiropractor $90 to fix my neck after craning it to crank these out, so I need help recuperating my expenses.

Here's what I'm giving you to help me justify my chiropractic costs:

- Major/minor scales (Mono/Stereo)
- Pentatonic scales (Mono/Stereo)*
- Stereo boosting impulse responses (Stereo only)

- Customer support (Mono only)

Note: if you hassle me, I may be obliged to crane my neck more and add more scales on command.

What you don't get:

Well, I spent my budget at the chiropractor, so you won't be getting a fancy user interface. I don't have fancy dynamic algorithms either. Nor do I have the budget for buying a pretentious holier-than-though-art copywriter who has the tact to write overly shortened quips to hook you visually so you don't read and just buy. I don't have that budget. It's just me and Ableton 10 with 2 extra paid plugins, and a few more free ones.

Not included:

- High quality beautiful interface
- Easy-to-use features like selecting the keys you want to use.
- Chroma plugin. (Couldn't get them to include it for $4, sorry.)
- No installer, no license key.
- My math and signal processing experience.
- 0 latency, that's up to your convolver to provide

How to use:

Drag the impulse responses into your convolution reverb plugin and adjust to your liking.
Things to remember:

$4 is less than a burger in most places, nowadays. Let alone a beer. For just $4 you could be coloring your sounds like a kid who just discovered crayons, but making professional, well-balanced impulse tracks.
